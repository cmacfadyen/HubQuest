<p>
    A file's extension lets you know what kind of a file it is.
    Sometimes you can see extensions (for example, on a Windows computer);
    other times they're hidden (for example, in Google Drive).
    When you can see the extension, it's a group of (typically 2 to 4) letters
    following a "dot" at the end of the file name.

For example, <span class="code">picnic.avi, picnic.pdf, picnic.docx</span>, and
<span class="code">picnic.ai </span>
are all files called "picnic."  But we can tell from the extensions that the
format and content of these files is very different.
